# Assignment4

in #task1.py, there is a file name "simple.txt", and we are trying to open the file to read the content of the file line by line and if file not found then it throws "Error: The file simple.txt was not found".

in #task2.py, here we are overwriting the file "output.txt"'s content then appending the content by taking input from user. After that we are reading the file content line by line.
